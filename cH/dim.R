##This is a function that will generate item response data based on a combination of unidimensional and  multidimensional models.
sim_md<-function(N=1000,n=10,
                 r=.5, #correlation of MD abilities
                 A=1 #the max loading on the second dimension, all loadings on first dimension are 1
                 ) {
    library(MASS)
    th<-mvrnorm(N,mu=c(0,0),Sigma=matrix(c(1,r,r,1),2,2,byrow=TRUE))
                                        #make first n items unidimensional
    b1<-rnorm(n)
    kern<-outer(th[,1],b1,"+") #this just creates a matrix consisting where element i,j is th[i,1]+b1[j]

    b2<-rnorm(n)
    mat<-list()
    for (i in 1:N) th[i,1]+a*th[i,2]+b2->mat[[i]] #this is where the multidimensional magic happens

    runif(N*n)->test
    ifelse(pv>test,1,0)->resp2
    resp<-cbind(resp1,resp2) #so first half of items will be unidimensional and second half multidimensional

sim_md()->resp ##note: this 'resp' matrix does not contain information about where it 'came from'. in particular, there is nothing about it that tells you it came from a multidimensional model! you have to figure that part out.

##Using this function, examine parameter recovery for the item parameters. my work is in dim-bd-work.R if you would like a guide.
##How does this depend on choice of r?
##How does this depend on choice of item response model? i would suggest focusing on the rasch and 2pl [confirm that i am not simulating any guessing]

##On fit statistics:
##They may or may not be pick up the ways in which things are going wrong here.
##If you have some insight into the ways the true DGP differs from the model-assumed DGP, you might have insight into fit statistics designed to detect such deviations.

##Thought: If you were so inclined, you could rework this into generating testlet data and study the effects of testlet structure on parameter recovery.
