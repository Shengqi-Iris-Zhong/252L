##Goal
##1. Make sense of how to simulate item response data
##2. See connection with logistic regression when theta is known.

################################################################
##first, we're going to simulate some data

##number of items and people.
##we'll start small just so that you can see everything, but you'll want to make this bigger downstream.
ni<-30
np<-2000
##now we're going to simulate data according to this model and examine some key properties
set.seed(12311)
##first let's describe the individual level part of the model
th<-rnorm(np)
th.mat<-matrix(th,np,ni,byrow=FALSE) #these are the true abilities. we don't observe them, which will be a real problem for us downstream. but we'll not worry about that today. 
##now the item level part.
##this is going to look like logistic regression, meaning we will have a slope and an intercept
a<-rep(1,ni)
a<-exp(rnorm(ni,sd=.3))
b<-rnorm(ni)
a.mat<-matrix(rep(a,np),np,ni,byrow=TRUE)
b.mat<-matrix(b,np,ni,byrow=TRUE) #these are the item difficulties

################################################################
##now we have to put this stuff together. what we want is a probability of a correct response for a person to an item
##we're going to use what you may know from logistic regression
inv_logit<-function(x) exp(x)/(1+exp(x))
##now the probability of a correct response is:
pr<-inv_logit(a.mat*(th.mat+b.mat)) #note this is pairwise multiplication not matrix multiplication.
##also, note that i am treating b.mat as item easiness params to make life simpler with mirt output

##we can simulate data using those probabilities
resp<-pr
for (i in 1:ncol(resp)) resp[,i]<-rbinom(nrow(resp),1,resp[,i])

################################################################
##we're going to now consider a practically infeasible method of estimating item parameters (we wouldn't actually have theta)
coefs<-list()
for (i in 1:ncol(resp)) {
    glm(resp[,i]~th,family="binomial")->mod
    coef(mod)->coefs[[i]]
}
do.call("rbind",coefs)->coefs
##what do we have here?


plot(b,coefs[,1]); abline(0,1) #what do you make of this? 

##ALWAYS REMEMBER: in practice you don't ever see th, a, or b. we are cheating here.

################################################################
##so let's estimate parameters and compare to our faked glm params
library(mirt)
mod<-mirt(data.frame(resp),1,itemtype="2PL")
co<-coef(mod)
co<-do.call("rbind",co[-length(co)])

par(mfrow=c(1,2),mgp=c(2,1,0))
plot(coefs[,2],co[,1],xlab="glm discrimination",ylab="mirt discrimination")
plot(coefs[,1],co[,2],xlab="glm difficulty",ylab="mirt difficulty")

plot(mod,type="trace") ##see variation in the slopes? is there a lot or a little? how could we change this in the code we used to simulate data?

################################################################
##now let's get theta values
theta<-fscores(mod,full.scores.SE=TRUE,method="ML") 
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(rowSums(resp),theta[,1],xlab="sum score",ylab="theta") ##not 1-1!
plot(theta,xlab="theta",ylab="se",ylim=c(0,.8))
